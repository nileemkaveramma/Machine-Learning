Machine Learning (ML) is a branch of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn patterns from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. In machine learning, algorithms are trained on data to recognize patterns, which they can then apply to new, unseen data. ML is widely used for applications like recommendation systems, fraud detection, predictive maintenance, and natural language processing.

This repository contains projects and resources for the study of Machine Learning (ML). It explores a variety of algorithms and techniques, from supervised learning (e.g., regression and classification) to unsupervised learning (e.g., clustering) and reinforcement learning. The content also covers model evaluation, feature engineering, and best practices in machine learning.
